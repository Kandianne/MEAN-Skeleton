## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make a working example of a MEAN stack application with users that I can build a generator off of.

*note:* This project uses [bcrypt](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js/). Make sure you have [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) installed on your computer.

This project comes with:

 - Client
	 - angular

And whatever else I decide to throw in as the project moves forward.
